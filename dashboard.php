                <p>Welcome to the Retail & Logistics Optimization Platform! In the dynamic landscape of e-commerce and logistics, efficient pincode-based serviceability is crucial for seamless operations. Our platform addresses the challenge of managing serviceability across a vast network of more than 30,000 pincodes and over 100 million merchants.</p>

                <p>Pincode-based serviceability empowers merchants to define the regions they can efficiently serve. Here at ONDC, we've separated the definition and verification processes, allowing merchants to articulate their serviceable pincodes, while buyers can easily verify whether their specific pincode falls within the serviceable range of any available merchant.</p>

                <p>Imagine dealing with a sparse matrix of 10 million merchants against 30,000 pincodes. Our challenge lies in creating an optimal data structure that facilitates near real-time verification for efficient serviceability.</p>

                <h3>Solution Showcase</h3>
                <p>Explore our innovative solution for the optimal representation of the m*n sparse matrix. Our platform not only defines and manages pincode serviceability by merchants but also ensures near real-time retrieval, making the verification process seamless and efficient.</p>
